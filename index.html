        <h1>Inheritance in JavaScript</h1>
        <div class="div1"></div>
        <p>
          Inheritance in JavaScript maintains an IS-A relationship. Then the
          keyword ‘extends’ is used in class expression or declaration. It is
          also used to acquire all the functionalities of the inbuilt object as
          well as custom classes. As stated below JavaScript is object-oriented
          but it is not like Java. It is a prototype base. Due to this, there
          are no classes. There are only objects. Hence for inheritance in
          JavaScript, we can use Prototypal or Pseudo classical inheritance. We
          will explain them in brief below.

      <h1>Types of inheritance in JavaScript</h1>
      <p>
        Inheritance in JavaScript is a very vast concept and there are many
        methods to implement it. Mainly there are three types of inheritance in
        JavaScript. They are, prototypal, pseudo classical, and functional. Now
        let us look at each type of inheritance in JavaScript and understand
        them properly.

          <h3>Prototypal Inheritance</h3>
          <p>
            This type of inheritance in JavaScript adds new properties and
            methods to the existing object. Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript
            makes use of prototype object that is object.prototype. It is a
            method through which an object can inherit the properties as well as
            the methods of another object. Initially, in order to get and set
            the [[Prototype]] of the object we used Object.getPrototypeOf and
            Object.setPrototypeOf. But now we can make use of __proto__.
          </p>

          <h3>Pseudo-classical Inheritance</h3>
          <p>
            This inheritance in JavaScript is very similar to the previous one,
            prototypal inheritance. In Pseudo classical inheritance, it emulates
            the classical inheritance by using prototypal inheritance. But if
            you are programming with ES6, then this type of inheritance in
            JavaScript is not supported. As one can use conventional classes
            that are using the keyword class. In Pseudo-classical inheritance,
            we try to create a class with a method that is intended to be called
            using the new keyword.

          <h3>Functional Inheritance</h3>
          <p>
            From the name of the inheritance, you understand that this type of
            inheritance in JavaScript makes use of functions. Functional
            Inheritance uses an augmenting function to the instance of the
            object in order to inherit the features of that object.
